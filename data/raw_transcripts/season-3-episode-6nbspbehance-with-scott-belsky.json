  "description": "Ben and David are joined by Adobe's Chief Product Officer, Behance founder, Benchmark partner, author, and product luminary, Scott Belsky, to tell the story of Adobe Systems' 2012 acquisition of Behance. We dive into the role it played in of one of the greatest (and least well-known) pivots of all time: Adobe's transition from packaged software to services, which over the past 6 years has generated an astounding $100B+ in market cap and nearly 10x growth in Adobe's share price!‍\nAnnouncement: We're super excited to announce our first SF live show on October 24th, 2018! We have an amazing story and guest lined up who we can't wait to share with you all. :) Tickets are very limited due to space constraints: please register early at http://acquired.fm/liveshow‍\nLinks:",
