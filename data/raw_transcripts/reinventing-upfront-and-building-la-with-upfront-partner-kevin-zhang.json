  "heading": "ACQ2 Episode",
  "date": "March 28, 2019",
  "description": "We’re joined by Upfront Ventures partner Kevin Zhang to discuss the evolution of both Upfront as a venture firm and the LA tech ecosystem more broadly. We cover the journey from Upfront’s founding as “Global Retail Partners” in 1996 to its place today as the premier and largest tech investor in Southern California. We talk about rebranding the firm and choosing Upfront as a name, launching the Upfront Summit, what LA is \"good and not good at\", and Kevin’s thesis around gaming as a great place for venture investing.",
