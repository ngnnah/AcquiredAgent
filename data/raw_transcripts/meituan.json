  "description": "The Complete History and Strategy of Meituan\nWe dive into the history behind Meituan, the juggernaut Chinese \"super-app\" which dominates China's services economy, offering consumers everything from food delivery, restaurant reviews, travel booking, bike-sharing, movie ticketing, and countless other entertainment and lifestyle services all at the touch of a button. Already China's 3rd largest tech company by market cap (behind just Tencent and Alibaba), Meituan did $15 billion in net revenue in FY2019 and continues to grow rapidly. What makes it so special, and how were they able to become the market leader in such a competitive space? This story is packed with lessons that apply equally beyond China tech to high-growth company building and investing everywhere.‍\nThe Meituan Playbook:\n1. Adding product offerings (post initial product-market fit) isn't losing focus. It's smart business.\n2. When you spot a market that's both large and growing fast — ride that wave!!\n3. Many still don't realize what a powerful moat (trusted) reviews provide in online platforms.\n4. Old news, but always worth repeating: the days of China simply cloning American tech companies are long gone. Today it's China, not the US, that's leading innovation on mobile and the internet more broadly across many categories.\n5. Meituan capitalized on the secular trend of China's growing middle class and mobile-first economy.\nLinks:\nCarve Outs:\nEpisode Sources:",
